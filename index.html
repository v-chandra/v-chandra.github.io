I lead an On-device AI applied research and engineering organization at Meta Reality Labs responsible for developing computer vision, machine perception and speech/NLU technologies for augmented reality glasses. This involves working with a large cross functional team of engineers and product managers to enable the AI use cases in our products. Our work cuts across the full ML stack - algorithms, model architecture, model optimization, deployment and SW/HW co-design. My research interests include all aspects of buiding efficient AI solutions.

I received a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2004. I have held the
positions of Visiting Scholar (2011 – 2014) and Visiting Faculty (2016 – 2017) at Stanford University.
I have authored 100+ research publications and am an inventor on 45+ US and international patents (granted and pending). I 
received the ACM-SIGDA Technical Leadership Award in 2009 and was invited to the 2017 National Academy of
Engineering’s Frontiers of Engineering Symposium. I am a senior member of IEEE.
