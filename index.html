I lead an On-device AI applied research and engineering organization at Meta Reality Labs
responsible for developing real-time on-device computer vision, machine perception and
speech/NLU technologies across AR/VR products. My research interests include all aspects of
SW/HW co-design for efficient on-device AI.

I received a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2004. I have held the
positions of Visiting Scholar (2011 – 2014) and Visiting Faculty (2016 – 2017) at Stanford University.
I have authored 100+ research publications and am an inventor on 40+ US and international patents. I 
received the ACM-SIGDA Technical Leadership Award in 2009 and was invited to the 2017 National Academy of
Engineering’s Frontiers of Engineering Symposium. I am a senior member of IEEE.
