I lead an AI research and engineering organization at Meta Reality Labs, building efficient on-device AI for mixed reality products, including AI glasses. Our work enables these wearables to understand context and take meaningful action, whether reactive or proactive. The goal: devices that perceive the world as you do, anticipate your needs, and reduce cognitive load. This is foundational technology for the next generation of human-device interaction.

Our work spans the full AI stack: algorithms, model architecture, optimization, and deployment. My research interests center on efficient AI, particularly multimodal models, generative AI, and on-device LLMs and vision-language models.

Before joining Meta in 2018, I was Director of Applied Machine Learning at Arm Research, where my team helped pioneer TinyML, enabling AI to run on small, resource-constrained devices.

I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University and have served as visiting scholar (2011-2014) and visiting faculty (2016-2017) at Stanford. I've authored 200+ research papers and am an inventor on 40+ patents.

I received the ACM-SIGDA Technical Leadership Award in 2009 and was invited to the National Academy of Engineering's Frontiers of Engineering Symposium in 2017. I'm a senior member of IEEE.
